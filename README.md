# Background_Oriented_Schlieren

This post contains all the code (or links to code/programs) that you will need for BOS processing.  This post accompanies my [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCUN59x0LF4) on the subject, which I recommend you watch.  If you would rather read, I have a comprehensive [PDF document](http://www.joshtheengineer.com/2019/10/20/how-to-take-pictures-like-nasa-using-background-oriented-schlieren-bos/) on the topic as well (it is too big for GitHub, so you can find it at my website).  All of these files can also be downloaded from my [website](http://www.joshtheengineer.com/2019/10/20/how-to-take-pictures-like-nasa-using-background-oriented-schlieren-bos/).

There are some free programs you will need for this project.  Below is a comprehensive list of those used in my video.

* [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html)
* [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
* [ImageJ/Fiji](https://fiji.sc/)
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

If you are running my Python GUI program, you will also need to download the following function file.

* [normxcorr2.py](https://github.com/Sabrewarrior/normxcorr2-python/blob/master/normxcorr2.py)

Again, all the files can also be found on my website.
